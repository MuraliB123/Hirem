the frontent should include 3 main pages: one for employee, one for user, one for admin. 
The page used by admin should have the input text box for the project desc.
the output should also be displayed right beneath it. then there should be a button for existing workforce utilisation which will call both modules 1 and 2 and then 
give output as a report in the same page.
There is one last button to generate a final output based on module 3 and the number of people who have applied for the job, then getting the same diplayed on the page
while for a new candidate who wishes to apply, the page is basically a form to get details and submit them to the backend db.
the one for employee is simply to show that the particular employee has been assigned to which project and his/her resp credit score.
